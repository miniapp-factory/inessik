Warm & Helpful Personal Growth App (Learning + Habits + Social Support)

Create a detailed concept and technical specification for a warm, positive, and helpful mobile app designed to support personal learning, habit-building, and healthy social interaction.
The app should feel friendly, emotionally supportive, inspiring, and focused on long-term personal growth without pressure.
Write in a soft, encouraging tone with a focus on user well-being.

Include the following core areas:
1. Learning & Personal Development

Personalized learning paths (skills, languages, creativity, productivity).

Short daily lessons designed to be enjoyable and stress-free.

AI-powered learning companion offering hints, summaries, and gentle explanations.

Progress timeline and milestones that focus on growth, not perfection.

2. Motivation & Habit Formation

Soft reminders based on user mood and energy levels.

Daily motivations, gratitude prompts, and small challenges.

Habit tracker with calming animations (plants growing, lights filling, etc.).

AI suggestions for improving routines in a gentle, caring way.

Reflection journal for emotional check-ins.

3. Social Warmth & Community Interaction

Supportive micro-groups for shared learning goals.

Positivity-based chat spaces (no negativity, no comparison).

Daily “kindness tasks” to encourage helpful interactions.

Collaborative progress boards where users can cheer each other on.

Anonymous “support messages” you can send or receive on difficult days.

4. Emotional Well-being Features

Mood tracker with comforting color themes.

Calming breathing exercises or mini-meditations before studying.

Encouraging affirmations tailored to user progress.

5. Technical Components

Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Web).

Cloud sync for progress and saved learning paths.

Local encrypted storage for private journal entries.

AI-based personalization engine.

6. UI/UX Style

Soft pastel palette or soothing dark mode.

Rounded edges, gentle animations, and a cozy design.

Interface that feels welcoming and calm.

7. Future Features

Peer study rooms

Shared habit challenges

AI-coach with a caring personality

In-app mini-courses created collaboratively by users

8. Unique Selling Point (USP)

A single app that teaches you, motivates you, and supports you emotionally — combining learning, habits, and human warmth in one gentle ecosystem.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo to be generated.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I can update the metadata file and create the logo description file.  
Please add the following file to the chat so I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I’ll supply the changes.
